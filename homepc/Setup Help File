1. xdg-open hack:
Open xdg-open file, go to open_xfce function and replace  'exo-open "$1"' command with
	[ $USER = "root" ] && gksu -u gv exo-open "$1" || exo-open "$1"

This will allow programms that call xdg-open for opening i.e web links (like yad --show-uri) to open the link using the user account.
Particularly Chrome breaks if run as root. Testit by terminal xdg-open www.google.com

xorg-server (2:1.18.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  X now defaults to using built-in modesetting video driver on Intel
  hardware which is "4th gen GMA" and newer, so roughly speaking on hardware
  from 2007 and up. If this triggers new bugs on your hw, please file them
  against the xserver.

  Continuing to use the -intel driver is possible by dropping the template
  xorg.conf to /etc/X11:

  # cp /usr/share/doc/xserver-xorg-video-intel/xorg.conf /etc/X11

2. Desktop / folder right click menu:
Select folder/file , open with, custom command , give optional friendly name and will automatically added to right click -context- menu.
add shortcut / launcher : lxshortcut -o /path/filename

/usr/share/applications
Find file mate-search-tool , open with editor
change entry OnlyShowIn=MATE; to MATE;XFCE;LXDE;
Now the mate-search-tool appears on the Application Menu of LXDE (Accessories)


Alternative/tip: Install alacarte from gnome.perfect menu editor.

4. Fix RTL WIFI problems (rtl8192se, rtl8723be,etc)
The main target is to disable all power saving options (fwlps,swlps,ips)
modinfo rtl8192se
systool -a -v -m rtl8192se
Gives you details about parameters of module 
to use systools you need sysfsutils installed
apt-get install sysfsutils

Alternativelly (this seems to work for me):
go to /etc/modprob.d directory
open file modesetting.conf
add at the end:
options rtl8192se modeset=1
options rtl8192se fwlps=0 ips=0 swlps=0

I verified with #systool -a -v -m rtl8192se
  Parameters:
    debug               = "0"
    fwlps               = "N"
    ips                 = "N"
    swenc               = "N"
    swlps               = "N"

"N" stands for No=0 , this is what we need, since modinfo advises:

Alternative way : use a script like this:
modprobe -r rtl8192se
sleep 3s
modprobe rtl8192se fwlps=0 ips=0 swlps=0
This also worked for me (using connman as network manager)

5. Disable all Network Managers and use hard coded configuration to connect to your WiFi
remove all wicd entries (apt-get purge wicd*),
you can install network-manager and network-manager-gnome to use the default gnome/mate connection manager.
Or you can install connman (by intel). If you just install package connman you will get the core command line package.
For Debian the right package is cmst , a connman gtk user interface. I also tried connman-ui but not found a way to run it
Finally i used cmst, configure the preferences for auto start minimized in system tray.
I also got to install connman-vpn, since cmst was complaining about vpn errors.
Maybe if you just install cmst will automatically install connman (core) and connman-vpn as dependencies.

Remark about System Tray: System tray is an "object" capable to be added in any panel.
If an application is configured to run in system tray, you must have added system tray in teh panel.
System tray is NOT the whole panel. Is an object of the panel.
In my case system tray object includes (finally) cmst and clipboard manager.

connman happened to fail after sid upgrade:
Unable to create an interface to connman on the system bus.
CMST will not be able to communicate with connman.
According to lxqt team is the iptables pkg who did the story.


6. Bug in xfce4-power-manager : install with sudo. run as user, edjust options, check "tray icon", tray icon displayed, but on the next reboot user settings are lost - tray icon is also lost. 
work arounds:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/407287/change-xfce4-power-manager-option-from-terminal
xfconf-query -> displays all chanels of xfce4
xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -l -> display properties of selected channel xfce4-power-manager
xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/lid-action-on-ac -> show the value of a specific channel property
xfconf-query -c xfce4-power-manager -p /xfce4-power-manager/lid-action-on-ac -s 1 -> -s = set property value to 1 

If you do not load power-manager it seems that the only propertie available is the acpi propertie (check /etc/acpi/events).

Initial settings loaded at start up: /etc/xdg/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml

7. Customizing LXDE Panels
/home/gv/.config/lxpanel/LXDE
/home/gv/.config/lxpanel/LXDE/panels
The trick is that you can create a panel that will be assigned to monitor 2 = VGA-1
Monitor 2 appears in config files as monitor=1 (monitor 0 is the monitor1=LVDS1 and monitor=-1 is applied when you select all monitors)
For sure top and bottom panel are not present in VGA1 in Extended desktop mode
Remark: Tray applet can be present only in ONE panel. Even if you apply all monitors to top panel, tray applet will be unique (placed at monitor VGA-1)

You can call lxpanelctl restart to force panels to go off and on.

Right Panel has been assigned to monitor 2 , but in mirror mode this panel is present in all monitors...So if you create a dedicate bottom panel on screen 2 , upon screen mirror this panel will overlap bottom panel of monitor 1. 
Better to delete it and then you can restart the panels .
I have the feeling that xrandr during application of new settings perform a kind of lxpanel restart. On the other hand, changes on lxanel are applied on the fly, without screen blinking.

root@debian32:/home/gv# lxpanelctl 

lxpanelctl - LXPanel Controller
Usage: lxpanelctl <command>

Available commands:
menu			show system menu
run			show run dialog
config			show configuration dialog
restart			restart lxpanel
exit			exit lxpanel
command <plugin> <cmd>	send a command to a plugin

8. Onboard  Configuartion on LXDE

You need to go at Start menu - Preferences - openbox configuration manager or just run obconf & from CLI.
Goto Windows menu and check "Place new windows under the mouse". Also in "Prefer to place new windows on:" select the monitor with the mouse. 

Moreover on default lxde panel (top or bottom, it depends on your set up) you need to go panel settings, panel applets, TaskBar (Window List) , Preferences, and check "Only show Windows on the same monitor as the task bar".
This helps task bar / window list to display minimized apps of it's own monitor. Window List of LVDS-1 has minimized windows of LVDS-1. You need to apply a second win list on monitor 2 panel to hold minimized windows of monitor 2. If this option is disabled, all window list applets will display minimized icons from all monitors.


9. Enable tap to click in touchpad if it is not operating (LXDE - was working out of the box in XFCE)
synclient TapButton1=1 (or just run synclient to see all available / configurable options)
Or follow the instructions here for a permanent solution
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/337008/activate-tap-to-click-on-touchpad/337009#337009
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf :
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Option "TapButton1" "1"

The file 50-synaptics.conf should exist at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf (even starting with different number , not 50).
Find it and copy it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d folder. 
In this folder user specific customizations are applied over general config files.
cp /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf
